<span style="line-height: 28px;"   >It has been a long time since I posted something here. It was not because life is boring; on the contrary, it is so fucking wonderful. Got admitted by CUHK in March, graduated peacefully in June, met quite a few new friends in HK recently, and quickly adapted to new environment and new life. I'm a lucky guy since I don't even need to rent a house for myself. Living with aunt and her family, I has been so considerably taken care of, with well prepared breakfast, free internet access, free lunch and dinner, timely guidance on any issues I don't know, and most importantly, a warm family.</span><div><br></div><div>Some of my friends studying in HK sometimes feel really lonely because they cannot fit in with the locals. Fortunately, I don't need to deal with too many of those cultural shocks since most of my fellow students come from the mainland China. They are smart, diligent, and willing to make new friends (though some of them looks cooler).&nbsp;</div>
